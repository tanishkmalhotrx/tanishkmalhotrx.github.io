								<h1 class="major">Artificial Intelligence (Part-1)</h1>
							<p><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> has got a major role to play in our lives. There are so many confounding ways in which AI is being used as behind the scenes to impact our everyday lives. When you hear news about artificial intelligence, it might be easy to assume it has nothing to do with you. You might imagine that artificial intelligence is only something the big tech giants are focused on, and that AI does not have any role in our mundane life. In reality, artificial intelligence is experienced by every aspect of life. AI assists in every area of our lives, whether we’re trying to read our emails, get driving directions, get music or movie recommendations.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>But before that, what exactly is AI?</b>
                                <br>
                                It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence. To put it in simple words, it is the ability of a smart machine to think, understand and learn like a human. AI also consists of Machine Learning(ML)>Deep Learning(DL). Further, AI can be categorized into 7 parts:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>1.</b> Reactive Machines-Has no memory, only responds to different stimuli.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>2.</b> Limited Memory -Uses memory to learn and improve its responses.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>3.</b> Theory Of Mind-Understands the needs of other intelligent entities.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>4.</b> Self-Aware-Has human like intelligence and self-awareness. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>The remaining three are a bit intricate to comprehend.</b>
                                <br>
                                <b>5. Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)</b><br>- This type of artificial intelligence represents all the existing AI, including even the most complicated and capable AI that has ever been created to date. <br>- Artificial narrow intelligence refers to AI systems that can only perform a specific task autonomously using human-like capabilities.<br>- These machines can do nothing more than what they are programmed to do, and thus have a very limited or narrow range of competencies.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>6. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</b><br>- It is the ability of an AI agent to learn, understand, and function completely like a human being.<br>- These systems will be able to independently build multiple competencies and form connections and generalizations across domains, massively cutting down on time needed for training.<br>- This will make AI systems just as capable as humans by replicating our multi-functional capabilities.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>7. Artificial Super-Intelligence (ASI)</b><br>- The development of Artificial Superintelligence will probably mark the pinnacle of AI research, as AGI will become by far the most capable forms of intelligence on earth.<br>- ASI, in addition to replicating the multi-faceted intelligence of human beings, will be exceedingly better at everything they do because of overwhelmingly greater memory, faster data processing and analysis, and decision-making capabilities.<br>- The development of AGI and ASI will lead to a scenario most popularly referred to as the ‘singularity’.-And while the potential of having such powerful machines at our disposal seems appealing, these machines may also threaten our existence or at the very least, our way of life.</p>
