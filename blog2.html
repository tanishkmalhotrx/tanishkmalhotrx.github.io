							<p><b>Some historical facts!</b><br>After WW2, a number of people independently started to work on intelligent machines. The English mathematician Alan Turing may have been the first. He gave a lecture on it in 1947. He also may have been the first to decide that AI was best researched by programming computers rather than by building machines. By the late 1950s, there were many researchers on AI, and most of them were basing their work on programming computers.<br><br><b>EXAMPLES!</b><br>So now, you might still be wondering where exactly is AI used? Examples of usage of AI are boundless. I’ll show you examples how artificial intelligence is used in day-to-day activities such as: <br>
                                · <b>Social Media</b><br>
                                · <b>Email Communication</b> <br>
                                · <b>Self Driving Vehicles</b><br>
                                · <b>Web Searching</b><br>
                                · <b>Stores & Services</b><br><br>
                                <b>How AI improves Social Media?</b><br>
                                AI makes it easier for users to locate and communicate with friends and business associates<br>
                                <b>Twitter </b><br>
                                From tweet recommendations to fighting inappropriate or racist content and enhancing the user experience, Twitter has begun to use artificial intelligence behind the scenes to enhance their product. They process lots of data through deep neural networks to learn over time what users preferences are.<br>
                                <b>Facebook</b><br>
                                Deep learning is helping Facebook draw value from a larger portion of its unstructured datasets created by almost 2 billion people updating their statuses 293,000 times per minute. Most of its deep learning technology is built on the Torch framework that focuses on deep learning technologies and neural networks.<br>
                                <b>Instagram</b><br>
                                Instagram also uses big data and artificial intelligence to target advertising and fight cyberbullying and delete offensive comments. As the amount of content grows in the platform, artificial intelligence is critical to be able to show users of the platform information they might like, fight spam and enhance the user experience.<br>
                                <b>Chatbots</b><br>
                                Chatbots recognize words and phrases in order to (hopefully) deliver helpful content to customers who have common questions. Sometimes, chatbots are so accurate that it seems as if you’re talking to a real person.<br><br>
                                <b>How Artificial Intelligence Improves Email Communications?</b><br>
                                <i>Smart Replies in Gmail</i><br>
                                Smart replies offer users a way to respond to emails with simple phrases like “Yes, I’m working on it.” or “No I have not.” with the click of a button. Smart replies are tailored to the content of each email. Users can reply by typing a manual response or may instead choose a one-click smart reply. For example, if you send an email to someone about an upcoming game and they reply to let you know that they interested in going to the game, Gmail offers “smart reply” options.<br><br>
                                <b>How AI helps you everyday through driving your car and parking it?</b><br>
                                Self-driving and parking cars use deep learning, a subset of AI, to recognize the space around a vehicle. Technology company Nvidia uses AI to give cars “the power to see, think, and learn, so they can navigate a nearly infinite range of possible driving scenarios,”. The company’s AI-powered technology is already in use in cars made by Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Volvo, and Tesla, and is sure to revolutionize how people drive and enable vehicles to drive themselves.<br><br>
                                <b>How Artificial Intelligence Helps With Web Searches?</b><br>
                                AI has been used to help with Google searches for quite some time.<br>
                                <i>Google Predictive Searches</i><br>
                                When you begin typing a search term and Google makes recommendations for you to choose from, that’s AI in action.
                                Predictive searches are based on data that Google collects about you, such as your location, age, and other personal details. Using AI, the search engine attempts to guess what you might be trying to find.<br><br>
                                <b>How Artificial Intelligence Improves Your Experience at Online Stores and Services?</b><br>
                                <i>Product Recommendations</i><br>
                                Amazon and other online retailers use AI to gather information about your preferences and buying habits. Then, they personalize your shopping experience by suggesting new products tailored to your habits.<br><br>
